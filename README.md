# ### ✨ Polish Draughts ♟️

Polish Draughts is a traditional board game that originated in Poland. 
Played on a checkered board, it involves two players who take turns moving their pieces diagonally.
The goal of the game is to capture all of your opponent's pieces or 
block them in a way that they can no longer make any legal moves. 
The game is flexible in terms of the board size.
While the standard version is played on an 8x8 board, 
variations with different dimensions exist.
